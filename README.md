This project aims to create a *local*, self-hostable implementation of the OpenTV platform, leveraging standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). Unlike traditional OpenTV deployments that rely on server-side infrastructure, this version is designed to run on any basic web server capable of serving static files, such as Node.js's `http-server` or even a simple file system. This comes with a trade-off, complex server-side languages like Python don't exist here. The focus on web standards ensures broad compatibility and allows for easy integration with existing web services and applications. This means that features often requiring dedicated backend development, like Plex integration, may already be available as community-developed solutions. This approach prioritizes portability, accessibility, and ease of use for local OpenTV setups.
