**Summary**
A local Version of OpenTV that can be ran on a web server like node.js's http-server or something else,
**Prerequisites**
It just needs to support html and js, that's literally it, don't be surprised, you might be asking (this thing can't python can it?) it can't but it has a pretty good trade-off, it supports common web technologies meaning that if you want Plex someone else's probably already made it.
